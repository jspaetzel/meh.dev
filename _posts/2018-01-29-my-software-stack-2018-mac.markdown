This year I switched from Windows to Mac. 

I re-evaluated all of the applications and replaced a lot when when I switched to Mac.

* [Grabbie](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grabbie/id1039705526) - Gif Search
* Keybase
* Skitch - Screenshot utility
* Magnet - Window management
* Flycut - Clipboard manager
* PHPStorm
* IntelliJ
* Visual Studio Code
* iTerm2
* GPGKeychain
* Standard Notes
* Firefox
* Google Keep - I've transitioned to using keep for reminders, temporary notes, and Todo lists
* Google Drive
* LastPass - I've been disenchanted recently with LastPass and am considering switching to 1Password.
* Authy - Replaced Google Authenticator
