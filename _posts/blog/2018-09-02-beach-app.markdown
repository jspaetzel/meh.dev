The Beach App (generic name, not decided yet) is a travel app that shows information and reviews about local beaches.

I started some preliminary design & research for this app in early 2018. After writing a post in August about [not working on as many side projects](when-did-i-stop-side-projects) I stopped planning and started building. 

See a preview of some of the iterations I've gone through while designing the main Beach View for the app:
