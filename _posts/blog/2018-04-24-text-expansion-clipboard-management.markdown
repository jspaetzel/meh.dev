If you dont currently use a text expander or a clipboard manager then stop what your doing **right now** and go download both. 
The two I use currently are Flycut and aText but there are lots of great alternatives. I suggest trying a few but give them some time to learn. 
And then read on... <!--more-->

#### Clipboard Manager
A clipboard manager I think is mostly self expanatory once you've used one. In general I have difficulty working without one now.

Need to copy and paste 4 things in different applications? Compare:
Copy, switch window, paste, switch window, ... repeat 3 more times.
vs 
Copy, copy, copy, copy, switch window, paste, paste, paste, paste.

More useful tricks: 
* Auto-trimming whitespace from clipboard items.
* Search your clipboard history. Stop copying the same thing more then once! Even hours later.
* Clip things for later that you think you might need.

#### Text Expansion
Getting started with a text expansion application takes more getting used to, it's not useful until you've built up a library of expansions. 

The main things I use it for currently. 
* Dates and times that I dont want to write out.
* Bookmarks. I've mostly replaced bookmarks with text expansion. I think it's just cleaner and faster. Also frees up a bit of browser space.
* Emojis. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` ✅ ❌ 👍 ☕️ I keep all of the important ones close at hand. `(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻` ⁉️
* Occasional shell commands

I got addicted to using a text expander when I worked in a support role for a few years during college. I had hundreds of job specific commands that included everything from shell scripting to writing entire emails. It was an absolute necessity that I couldn't work without.
