The enlightened helper is a quick utility I built over the christmas break for checking the remaining time in the current Ingress checkpoint.

This is my first project with the Alexa Dot which I won from the Dominion Enterprise Hack Data Hackathon building [Cod3]({% post_url blog/2016-12-03-Cod3 %}).
