This is a living post for what I use frequently, probably everyday. I'll update this periodically and welcome suggestions for improvements.

## Systems
* Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon with Ubuntu 20.10 ‚ù§Ô∏è
* Macbook Pro with Ubuntu 20.10, Windows 10
* Pixel 3 ‚ù§Ô∏è
* iPhone 8
* Ubiquity UniFi ‚ù§Ô∏è
* Sonnet Breakaway box with Nvidia 1070 ‚ù§Ô∏è

I prefer to work in Ubuntu but my personal laptop is a Macbook Pro which I got in 2017. It runs Ubuntu pretty well so I've kept it around. I also use it for gaming which is why I have a tri-boot configuration.

I have an iPhone from work but my main device is the Pixel 3. I've kept the iPhone because I like to compare functionality side-by-side and it's also handy to have a backup device on a different network provider.

## Developer Tools

* Editor: VS Code
* Terminal: Terminator
