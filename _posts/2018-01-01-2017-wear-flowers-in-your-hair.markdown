Overall 2017 has been a very social year. I didn't do as much work and made a point of catching up with friends who I hadn't seen in a while. Anything social besides multi-day trips are not listed here. It might be interesting to try to keep track of that next year a separate calendar for more analysis.

The biggest event of 2017 was my move to San Francisco. Leading up to that for several months was a lot of preparation. I knew roughly what I wanted to do as early as February, from that point on it was just figuring out how to make that happen. Hopefully 2018's retrospective will validate my decision making in 2017. It's been a busy year with a lot of changes that affected my career and personal life. For 2018 I dont have any big changes in mind, rather im going to focus on all of the little things.
