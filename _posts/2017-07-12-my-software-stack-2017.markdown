This is an update on last year's article

This year I still spent most of my time working in Windows so this list also does not include most Linux tools. A list of changes can be found at the bottom of this page.

# Changes since last year
 - Removed Visual Studio versions 2013 & 2015, I now use 2017 for all of my .NET projects.
 - Removed Atom in favor of lighter editors, mainly Visual Studio Code and Notepad++. Atom feels as big and sluggish as an IDE but without the advantages of a full IDE. So I've stopped using it entirely.
 - Removed Cygwin which I have not been using
 - Added Bash for Windows which is incredibly useful since you have all of the advantages that come with the Ubuntu ecosystem.
 - Added PowerShell finally and use it pretty frequently for general operations.
 - Added Application Insights which has largely replaced New Relic for me. Though I still prefer New Relic for database server and instance monitoring.
 - Added NPM which is the defacto standard for JavaScript packages. I also now use it to start my frontend apps, run test frameworks, and initiate builds for them. It's also very useful for random other commands like rimraf.
 - Added Discord for gaming related voice and text chat.
 - Added Project Rider which has proved itself to be faster then Visual Studio when working with large .NET projects
 - Removed Google Tasks. I'm finally used to using Google Keep and have entirely converted to it.
 - Added Feedly for RSS feed reading.
 - Added several tools which are not new to me, but were just not on this list. Gimp, Ditto and Bulk Rename Utility.
 - Added Calibre which I have finished importing my eBook library into. I keep the library synced between systems with google drive.
