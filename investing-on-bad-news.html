    <p>It’s a pretty easy to make money in the stock market currently and has been for the last several years, and so it’s been a really good time to learn about investing. I have a Vanguard 401k, a <a href="http://join.robinhood.com/johns536">personal account with Robinhood</a> which I invest manually, and a new <a href="https://www.sofi.com/share/invest/2424769">automated investing account with SoFi</a>.</p>

<h2 id="my-performance-in-2019">My performance in 2019</h2>
<p>Over 2019 performance has not been bad. I easily beat my minimum target of 6% but these numbers could &amp; should be higher. The S&amp;P 500 hit 28.5% and Nasdaq did better at 35%!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vanguard: <strong>9%</strong></li>
  <li>Robinhood: <strong>27%</strong> in 2019</li>
  <li>SoFi Automated (aggressive): Too new for a percentage. (I want to see how this compares to the other two as another point of reference and will write another post in the future.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m comfortable with having an aggressive stock portfolio so later last year I shifted Vanguard over to mostly stocks and have seen better performance since then. I’m more limited to specific funds with that account so it’s mostly hands off now.</p>

<p>As for Robinhood my strategy is going to remain similar, I think I just need to follow my own advice more often and not take as many risks on less known companies.</p>

<h2 id="picking-companies">Picking companies</h2>
<p>The hardest part for me is picking companies. The companies that have done best for me are ones that I’m personally familiar, I’ve used their products, I know their quality, and hopefully I’ve met a few people who work there. Whereas the worst performing ones have been companies that I know by name but most of my insight is from the news rather then hands on experience.</p>

<h3 id="my-5-top-performers-overall">My 5 top performers (overall)</h3>
<p>Apple and Microsoft are obvious winners that everyone should probably own.</p>

<ol>
  <li>AMD 349%</li>
  <li>Ubiquity 155%.</li>
  <li>Apple 101%</li>
  <li>Microsoft 96%</li>
  <li>PG&amp;E 86%.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ubiquity was an interesting buy because I setup one of their products and bought a few shares in the same week. I was convinced immediately using their product that they’d do well and I still feel this way.</p>

<p>PG&amp;E is another interesting choice, I felt really strongly that they’d recover after the disaster they went through last year and so far that’s been true, albeit slowly over many months.</p>

<p>AMD was a bit of a fluke, I felt like they were really undervalued and bought at the perfect time during a dip. For PG&amp;E and AMD I felt confident enough to invest a small sum, next time I think I’ll try a little more.</p>

<h3 id="my-5-worst-performers-overall">My 5 worst performers (overall)</h3>
<p>The ones I’m most familiar with are GM and Boeing which I’ve learned more about and think they’ll turn around.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Barclays -10%</li>
  <li>GM -10%</li>
  <li>Charles Schwab -9%</li>
  <li>Boeing -9%</li>
  <li>GE -5%</li>
</ol>

<p>The thing I did wrong on all of these was that I didn’t really know much about the companies before buying them. I’ve only briefly used Barclays, I know whats in Charles Schwab’s portfolio, I’ve never bought a GM car or a GE appliance, and im not buying an airplane from Boeing anytime soon. So for all 5 of these I don’t have a relationship which explains why I am out of touch.</p>

<h2 id="buying-stocks">Buying stocks</h2>
<p>Once I’ve picked a company out I start watching it’s ticker. I rarely buy the first time I look it up, rather check several times to see how it’s performing. In general I’ll wait for a large dip which is usually the result of some bad news. My philosophy here is that companies that I’ve picked I believe can withstand controversy, if something bad happens, they’ll bounce back.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Follow news, wait until something bad affect the stock price.</li>
  <li>Watch stock prices fall, follow news.</li>
  <li>Buy stock at a low point of ~15% or more below previous market avg when it appears to be leveling off.</li>
  <li>Watch stock price rise and hold until the previous high has passed. Or hold permanently.</li>
</ol>

<p>This strategy doesn’t get any <strong>big</strong> wins since it mostly just improves on the initial purchase. But it’s worked well enough so far, and I think if I stick with better companies my rates will improve.</p>

<h2 id="buying-options">Buying options</h2>

<p>I’m trying options trading now as well and am following a related strategy.</p>

<p>At the same time I decide if I’m going to buy a stock I also do a quick analysis for how quickly I think it will bounce back. If my gut says it’ll bounce back within a few weeks I buy calls and then track things closely.</p>

<p>So far I’m up about 200% with this strategy and intend to only re-invest as much as I profit to limit my exposure.</p>
