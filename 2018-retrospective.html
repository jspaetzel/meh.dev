    <p>Wow. It’s already been a year, it felt like a longer period of time in a shorter window of space. This year I adjusted to a new city and in a lot of ways a new life. I came at it with no specific goals so I can proudly say that I accomplished everything I set out to do. I’ve been unaccountable and it has been glorious.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>I’ve excluded most social activities from this list because there were so many this year. I went to a bunch of musicals, the symphony, golden gate park several times, once for a reddit meetup and as many outings to Dolores Park. I went to the California Academy of Sciences, the Castro Theatre, and many nights at the Exploratorium. I became a regular at gaymer night, musical mondays, and beer.js. I hosted several gaming events at work to play civilization and went pumpkin picking in Half Moon bay. There were tons of shenanigans for pride, folsom, and halloween. I even went to napa 3 times. And those are just the things that didn’t make the list this year.</p>

<p>I can conclusively say that this has been a very good year.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to 2019, although with some hesitation. This year was easy. 2019 is going to be slightly less comfortable. I’m going to push myself and that’s never easy. I’m working on improving some habits this year that I think I can improve on.</p>

<p>I have specific goals for 2019, here they are.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nurture the relationships I made in 2018.</li>
  <li>Make fitness a priority. 3-5 days a week exercising, up from 1-3.</li>
  <li>Release the beach app by August.</li>
  <li>Publish more to my blog. Weekly.</li>
  <li>Refresh the style of this blog.</li>
  <li>Read more non-fiction books. I have 2 in the queue and am looking for at least one more.</li>
  <li>Buy plants and don’t kill them.</li>
  <li>Travel more. More then 3 trips of a more then 2 days.</li>
</ul>
