    <p>How about this week? This year? These questions set the stage for what I do today so I make it a priority everyday to keep track.</p>

<p>The main way I did this in the past was with a notebook, graph paper, and lots of sticky notes.</p>

<p>I changed my workflow when I joined <a href="https://www.hellosign.com/">HelloSign</a>. The company as a whole strives to be paperless so I was inspired to try something new and wholly switched to making my notes digitally.</p>

<p>I now use <a href="https://standardnotes.org/">Standard Notes</a>. Standard Notes is a cross platform, open source, locally encrypted note taking application that primarily supports text and markdown. It has a short feature set that focuses on writing notes and searching for notes you’ve written which are the only thing I really want to do.</p>

<p>I’ll normally create several notes throughout a busy day. They generally come down to 3 types.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The day journal. Almost every date or every few days I create a note that’s just about the day or maybe a couple days. It might have things I need to do, things I want to reference later, sometimes it’s just a brief summary. It’s usually titled with the date and maybe a highlight.</li>
  <li>The post. A topic that I’ve started thinking about a little but im not yet ready to draft. Usually these are just musings. Sometimes I tag these different ways, whether it’s something I want to publish to my blog or otherwise.</li>
  <li>TICKET-1234: Sometimes if im working on a specific ticket for several days ill create a note for that topic and ill keep that note updated day to day until it’s done. These are usually Jira epics and often transfer into wiki articles for documentation well.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been writing all of my notes digitally for around 8 months and it’s come out to a huge success. Standups are easier since I simply summarize my notes, I can store more context since it’s digital and I can copy &amp; paste, and I think my overall performance has improved significantly.</p>
