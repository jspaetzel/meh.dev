    <p>Today one of my personal servers reached a new milestone, it’s 4th year of service! To commemorate the occasion I’ve written about how I run my servers in a way that is maintainable. <!--more--> I’m also excited because I just updated from PHP 5.6 to PHP 7.0 and from Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 with no serious problems. This was the most maintenance I have had to do in the last 4 years and it only took several hours.</p>

<h2 id="what-runs-on-them">What runs on them?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Websites that I personally maintain and develop</li>
  <li>Friends websites which are mostly WordPress and a few static sites</li>
  <li>A Mono web api</li>
  <li>Half a dozen cronjobs</li>
  <li>Mailboxes for my domains</li>
</ul>

<p>When a website or service starts to outgrow the resources of this shared box I re-evaluate it’s needs. At that point it might move to the cloud.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-you-run-servers-yourself">Why do you run servers yourself?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>It keeps me up to date on server technologies. I think its important for any developer who works on backend software to understand the rest of the server. For example, understanding how workers work in a web server can directly affect high level applications are designed.</li>
  <li>I can generally get better performance from my applications over hosting it on a PAAS.</li>
  <li>It saves time on new development, the setup step is complete before starting.</li>
  <li>Sometimes it’s useful to have a shell that’s always online and unrestricted for commands. Ever need an SSH proxy in another country?</li>
  <li>It’s cheap! $$$</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost-what-are-the-specs">How much does it cost, what are the specs?</h2>
<p>I pay <em>$54/year</em> for one server.</p>

<p>The specs I have on my primary server are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 CPU cores</li>
  <li>1 GB of memory</li>
  <li>3 TB of data transfer, up to 10 Gbit/s</li>
  <li>30 GB of SSD storage</li>
  <li>1 Dedicated IPv4 address</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a comparison based on the closest available options based on the specs of my primary server listed above.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Current</th>
      <th>AWS LightSail</th>
      <th>DigitalOcean</th>
      <th>Azure</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>$54/yr</td>
      <td>$120/yr</td>
      <td>$240/yr</td>
      <td>$205/yr</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I tried to compare a few others but most cloud providers optimize for higher memory and scale then I need. It may be easier to compare larger instances. GCM is between $49.06/yr and $1,292.10/yr depending on which resources are shared. I encountered a similar issue when trying to compare AWS EC2 instances directly.</p>

<p>Note: My estimates only consider CPU, Memory, Transfer, and same instance SSD storage. These estimates do not take into account fees, licensing costs, or storage when charged separately from cpu &amp; memory. I’m disregarding special features &amp; services that may raise the value of services that are specific to each provider.</p>

<h2 id="hows-the-uptime">How’s the uptime?</h2>
<p>I’ve had one <a href="https://partyvan.eu/transparency/emails/2015-02-17-prometeus-outage.txt">notable outage</a> in the last 4 years. A friend added one of my domains to his monitoring service back in 2010. <a href="http://chemicalservers.grd.net.pl/monitor/archive/?2016-10-01">You can see uptime for every day since 2010 here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-your-stack">What is your stack?</h2>
<p>I use a control panel on my systems to allow myself and other developers to interact with the server more easily. For this I use <a href="https://vestacp.com/">Vestacp</a> it makes managing the server easier on myself without getting in the way.</p>

<p>My current stack with this is</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nginx in front of Apache with mod_php7, mod_mono for websites</li>
  <li>NodeJS: Server side applications</li>
  <li>MySQL: Database</li>
  <li>Bind9: DNS Server</li>
  <li>Exim: SMTP Server</li>
  <li>Dovecot: IMAP/POP3 Server</li>
  <li>vsftpd: FTP Server</li>
  <li>iptables: Firewall</li>
  <li>Cron: Scheduling</li>
  <li>New Relic: Monitoring</li>
  <li>Blackfire: PHP performance testing</li>
</ul>

<p>I frequently swap parts in and out. Sometime in the next few months ill probably add a Go server behind Nginx.</p>

<h1 id="how-long-have-you-been-doing-this">How long have you been doing this?</h1>
<p>I have two servers currently:
Server A: I’ve had this one for 4 years tomorrow. During that time it’s had only one notable outage for several hours.
Server B: I didn’t need this one when I got it, but my provider had a killer Black Friday. Turned out to be useful so I kept it since November 2015.</p>

<p>Since 2009 I have had several other servers with other providers. I’m pretty happy with my current one though and haven’t needed to switch since 2013.</p>

<h2 id="whos-your-provider">Who’s your provider?</h2>
<p>I presently use <a href="https://www.prometeus.net/">prometeus</a> which has been a good experience. They have the right mix of support for me. I only contact them when there’s something I cant do from the control panel they provide, which means I’ve only ever contacted them with billing questions.</p>

<h2 id="thanks-for-reading">Thanks for reading</h2>
<p>If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me. While writing this I realized there are several more topics that I could go into greater depth on and which will likely be future posts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advantages &amp; disadvantages of hosting a website in a shared server environment</li>
  <li>An overview of VestaCP for managing a server and websites</li>
  <li>Configuring Nginx with a Go web server</li>
</ul>
